        <p><blockquote><i>A cat is a small, carnivorous mammal known for its agility, independence, and graceful movements. With sharp claws, keen senses, and a playful yet aloof nature, cats are popular pets worldwide. They are skilled hunters and often enjoy lounging, grooming themselves, and interacting with their environment.
